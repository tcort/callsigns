# TODO List

A list of tasks I'm considering doing:

* public API for getting callsign data as JSON
* improve search query
  * searching for 'QC' should get all results from Quebec
* h1 headings for SEO
* automated testing on each commit (travis-ci)
* figure out how to make it globally installable (i.e. `npm install -g callsigns`). Should be easier without `bower install` step.
